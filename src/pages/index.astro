		Hello my dear patron. My doors are open to any and everyone. I, Kaleel Boston, was not always interested 
		in programming. But, as the years go by I got exposed to it. First time was at a little coding camp at my 
		secondary school in 3rd form. The next was at the same secondary school in 5th form. I encountered programming 
		again during my IT classes. At this time, I was fairly new to programming, but I got a surge of dopamine whenever 
		my code worked. This then led me to choose to pursue an Associates degree in it. And well here I am. 
		
		<br><br>

		This tavern is a demonstration of my skills. And why not let you get to know me at the same time. <br>
		Explore till you are content!
