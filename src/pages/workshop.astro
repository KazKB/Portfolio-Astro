            Otaku Paradise is a basic ecommerce website that specialises in sellings anime merchandise. 
            It was a originally a pure HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT project for an introductory web development 
            course. The first iteration of the website was done as a team as shown on the About Us page. 
            As for the second iteration which is the last one, I added PHP to it. The PHP was to allow 
            login and sign up (profile), reviews and cart to function as well as save the relevant data 
            to CSV files or session variables. This iteration was for a more advanced course I did by myself.
