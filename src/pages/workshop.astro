            Otaku Paradise is a basic ecommerce website that specialises in sellings anime merchandise. 
            Users were not able to actual purchase any merchandise. The sites aim was to demonstrate 
            the basic skills that were taught in class. So, the site was more visual than practical. 
            Otaku Paradise was worked on for two iterations. The first iteration was originally a pure HTML, 
            CSS and JAVASCRIPT project for an introductory web development course done as a team as shown on 
            the About Us page. While the second iteration was done solo with PHP added to it. The PHP was to allow 
            login and sign up (profile), reviews and cart to be more practical and work rather than just visual. 
            The relevant data were saved to CSV files or session variables.

            The app version of the previous project, Otaku Paradise (Website). This was for an introductory 
            mobile development course I did. Again, it was a solo run. It has some practical parts such as 
            a working cart and login. But that is it.

        <h2>Retro Tavern's Journey</h2>
        <p>
            Retro Tavern was originally going to be an autobiography with a black and white theme. The pages would follow
            a house's room naming sense such as have been front door (homepage/index), bedroom (status/profile), kitchen (
            eating habits, likes and dislikes), living room (hobbies/past times), and basement (workshop/my works). However, 
            I scrapped the idea as I didn't have a good grasp on who I was, what I like, and my traits. Ironic isn't it. 
            I didn't know who I was, yet <em>I knew who I was</em>. Technically, I still don't know myself to an extent, 
            but I know enough for viewers to get a basic understanding. Anyway, that was since the 25<sup>th</sup> May, 2022. After 
            I graduated from <abbr title="Antigua & Barbuda International Institute of Technology">ABIIT</abbr> I  
            restarted my project. However, this time I changed from an autobiography to my current portfolio site. 
            It was started on the 6<sup>th</sup> November, 2022. And I will be honest right now. Although I had a plan,
            content and a layout in mind, it was not a concrete design. So, I encountered a number of road bumps.
            However, at the randomest of times, designs come into my head. And eventually I reached here.<br>
            Currently the site is being created with the help of the Javascript Framework called Astro. I originally 
            coded it the old fashion way in Visual Studio Code. That was until a good friend of mine introduced me to 
            Astro. It was what I hoped the future of programming would be. Different languages and frameworks combined 
            into one. Instead of there being millions of different langauges or frameworks out there. Well, technically 
            it is still the same, just interconnected.
            <br><br>
            Down below are screenshots of the autobiography and the hard coded version.
