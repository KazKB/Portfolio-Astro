        <p>
            Otaku Paradise is a basic ecommerce website that specialises in sellings anime merchandise. 
            It was a originally a pure HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT project for an introductory web development 
            course. The first iteration of the website was done as a team as shown on the About Us page. 
            As for the second iteration which is the last one, I added PHP to it. The PHP was to allow 
            login and sign up (profile), reviews and cart to function as well as save the relevant data 
            to CSV files or session variables. This iteration was for a more advanced course I did by myself.

        <h2>Retro Tavern's Journey</h2>
        <p>
            At first Retro Tavern was originally going to be an autobiography with a house kind of naming sense, 
            and a black and white theme. Meaning the pages would have been front door (homepage), bedroom (what 
            falls under Status on this site), kitchen (eating habits, likes and dislikes), living room (hobbies/past 
            times), and basement (what falls on workshop on this site). However, I scrapped the idea as I didn't 
            have a good grasp on who I was, what I like, and my traits. Ironic isn't it. I didn't know who I was, 
            yet <em>I knew who I was</em>. Technically, I still don't know myself to an extent, but I know enough 
            for viewers to get a basic understanding. Anyway, that was since the 25<sup>th</sup> May, 2022. After 
            I graduated from <abbr title="Antigua & Barbuda International Institute of Technology">ABIIT</abbr> I  
            restarted my project. However, this time I changed from an autobiography to the current portfolio site. 
            I started it on the 6<sup>th</sup> November, 2022. And I will be honest right now. I had no plan, and I 
            still don't. I am 100% winging it. Designs come into my head at the randomest of times, and as I am free 
            as a bird, I get to work when the thoughts designs appear. It can be right as I am about to go sleep or 
            as I just wake up.
            <br><br>
            Currently the site is being created with the help of the Javascript Framework called Astro. I originally 
            coded it the old fashion way in Visual Studio Code. That was until a good friend of mine introduced me to 
            Astro. It was what I hoped the future of programming would be. Different languages and framesworks combined 
            into one.
            <br><br>
