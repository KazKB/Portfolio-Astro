        I am not that much of an active person. Most of my free time is spent online and indoors. That is not to say that I don't go out at all. It is just that I grew up a little sheltered, so I had to find a way to not be bored inside the comfort of my walls. <br><br>

        These are the hobbies my lifestyle got me into:
        <li>Anime (Rarely Now)</li>
        <li>Exercise - Bodyweight, Free Weights, Machines</li>
        <li>Gaming - Moblile, Emulated (GBA/DS)</li>
        <li>Reading - Korean Novels, Manga, Manhua, Manhwa</li>
        <li>Taking Naps</li>
        <li>Vibing to Music - JPop, Kpop, Etc </li>
        <li>Youtube</li>

        <h2>0's & 1's Come To Life</h2>
        <h3 class="sub-heading">A New World, A New Adventure</h3>
        <p>
            I love games. They are an escape from reality as well as a gateway to captivating stories. However, despite my fondness or excite for them I am not really a gamer. Growing up, I spent more time watching others play than playing myself. This was due to the fact that I didn't have many games for that I had, or not having a strong enough computer. I grew up with Nintendo DS, Nintendo 3DS and A New Nintendo 3DS. At most I had 4 games for each console. I don't remember all that I have had. Besides my Nintendo consoles, I did have laptops. However, they were not strong enough to run the popular or more CPU and GPU extensive games at the time.<br><br>

            My Current Equipment Loadout Is:
            <li>HP Laptop 15 - AMD Ryzen 3 3250U, 16GB RAM, 1TB Storage</li>
            <li>New Nintendo 3DS (Archived)</li>

        <h2>Who Needs Reality When There's 2D</h2>
        <h3 class="sub-heading">2D Brought to Life</h3>
        <p>
            Anime in its simplest terms is Japanese animations. With its Chinese and South Korean counterparts being Donghua and Hanguk Aeni/Hanguk Aenimeisyeon. Many persons believe that anime is for kids. And honestly, I can see where that thought may arise from. After all some of the most popular or common-place anime in the western world are <i>Bakugan, Pokémon</i> and <i>Yu-Gi-Oh</i>. But, contrary to popular belief, they are for everyone. After all there are genres like Ecchi where breasts can be seen if not censored or Seinen which target audience is adults. There are also gruesome and gory anime like Tokyo Ghoul and Parasyte. So, anime is not just children's shows or cartoons. Same for their comic counterpart. 
            <br><br>
            Based on my rant above, you can guess that I am an avid anime indulger. I have been watching anime officially since 2014. Well, technically I started before that. I used to watch <i>Bakugan, Beyblade, Dragon Ball, Pokémon, Sonic X</i> and <i>Yu-Gi-Oh</i> on tv without knowing that they were anime. And ironically, the reason I started officially was due to a cousin who does not watch or like anime suggesting me to watch the animations of the online games I watched when I was in my last year of primary school. So, thanks to that cousin's suggestion I started my journey into the world of anime by randomly searching online. During my search I came across the goated anime streaming site called KissAnime. It allowed me to watch anime as streaming platforms didn't have access to Antigua at the time, or I couldn't pay the subscription fees.
            <br><br>
            Thanks to KissAnime I was able to keep track of my anime as well as stream episodes and movies. However, all that ended when it was shutdown in 2020 as it was an illegal site. Due to its shutdown, I lost all my progress. But, later in 2020, a friend recommeded a tracker called Anime-Planet to me. Since he was an otaku (anime nerd) like me I took his word and created an account. Creating that account was a great idea. Anime-Planet has an extensive database of animations and comics from China, Japan, and South Korea. And that is not all. It even has a little recommendations section passed on other users input, plus news on upcoming releases. So, based on my experience I recommend everyone who is interested in anime and the such to get a tracker whether it is Anilist, Anime-Planet, Kitsu, MangaUpdates, MyAnimeList, or etc.... Even if it is just regular tv shows and movies you can use IMDB. IMDB also has anime on it, but it is only for shows and movies (no comics).

        <h2>Anime on Paper - Korean Novels, Light Novels, Manga, Manhua & Manhwa</h2>
        <h3 class="sub-heading">Ink Tells A Whole Story</h3>
        <p>
            Manga is the Japanese form of comics. With its Chinese and South Korean counterparts being manhua and manhwa respectively. Manga unlike other forms of media is read right to left and is in black and white. This can take some getting used to. But once you are accustomed it does not phase you. Heck, you would find yourself reading reverse automatically. And apparently manhua is the same. But, to be honest I read it left to right. I just start with the hightest text bubble. And it works. Manhwa on the other hand is read left to right like a regular comic. And both manhua and manhwa are colored unlike manga.
            <br>
            Other than comics, there are novels. The two types are Light Novels and Regular Novels. Light Novels are the Japanese twist to a novel. It is a combination of a regular novel and illustrations. Throughout a light novel there are single page illustrations besides the written story. And I am sure you already know what a regular novel is.

            Synopsis: <br>                    
            Jigokumeguri Haru is the heiress of one of the largest business empires in all of Japan. She is not only rich, but also practically a celebrity. However, partly because of her heritage and partly because of her arrogant and aloof behavior, she has always been isolated from her peers and has never been able to make friends. Thus, she has—without success so far—transferred from school to school to finally find a place where she would be accepted.
            <br><br>
            This only begins to change when she meets her new classmate Kawayanagi Tsurezure, an outcast weirdo that dresses in 20th century fashion, talks little and smiles even less. Being both somewhat socially awkward, they thus begin an unexpected friendship.
